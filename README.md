# Bev's Boba Cafe

## Overview

Welcome to Bev's Boba Cafe, a customizable and interactive bubble tea ordering experience! This project lets users craft their perfect drink with playful interactions, engaging animations, and an immersive UI inspired by early 2000s video games. Whether you're a boba enthusiast or a first-timer, this app turns ordering bubble tea into a fun, gamified journey.

This project was created to refine my design skills and provide a seamless user experience using **Figma** and **JS/HTML/CSS**.

## Features

### 🎯 **User Engagement**

- **Higher Color Contrast in Selected and Active Elements**: By enhancing the contrast of selected options, users can easily identify their choices, leading to smoother interactions and improved accessibility.
- **Popup for Milk Selection on Tea Choices**: When selecting Jasmine Green Tea or Classic Black Tea, a popup asks if users want milk, creating a more personalized, streamlined decision-making process.

### 🛒 **User Flow Optimization**

- **"Ready to Check Out" Button Conditional Visibility**: To prevent premature checkout attempts, the "Ready to Check Out" button only appears once a tea is selected, ensuring that users follow a logical flow during the ordering process.
- **Fully Reset All Values for New Order Experience**: Every new order begins with a clean slate, as all previous selections and order details are reset, offering users a fresh and error-free experience each time.

### 🎨 **Interactive Design and Feedback** (Desktop Only)

- **Hover Text and Styling Changes**: On desktop devices, buttons provide instant visual feedback through hover effects—text changes and box shadows darken when the user interacts with them—making the app more engaging and guiding users through their selections.

### 🎁 **Final Experience and Satisfaction**

- **Polaroid-inspired Bordered Background for Final Order**: A smooth transition from the customization page to the order summary, using a "polaroid" effect, gives users a sense of closure and accomplishment upon completing their order.
- **Bounce Animation for Drink Elements**: Tea, toppings, and ice bounce slightly to create a dynamic, "live" feel, making the drink feel tangible and enhancing the interactive experience.
- **Randomized Success Messages**: Personalized success messages such as “Yum, you’ve got great taste!” and “Perfectly brewed, perfectly you!” provide a fun, rewarding conclusion to the user’s journey.
